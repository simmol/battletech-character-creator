SPACER FAMILY:
    cost: 490
    Description: "The child of a spacer family is raised in the low-gravity and sterilized-atmosphere world of DropShips and JumpShips, rarely setting foot on planets long enough to take root. Characters from this background tend to be a little more insular toward outsiders, but are in their element when out in the \"black sea\"."
